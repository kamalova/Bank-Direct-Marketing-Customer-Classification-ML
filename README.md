#### Author: Nurgul Kurbanali kyzy
###  Overview
As It is a marketing problem a lot of resources are included and it is very important to optimise results to save resources. The target variable is ‘deposit’ which reads yes or no based on success or failure of phone calls. Finding out only those clients which have higher chances of saying yes to subscription of term deposit , will save a lot of manhours and efforts. Predicting as many positives as possible out of actual positives from dataset is the goal here, thus recall has been chosen as one of the performance matrices along with an accuracy score. As our data are imbalanced, we used oversampling method during the model building process. After preprocessing the data, we build nine model including baseline model. The optimal model we get is Random Forest Classifier.
